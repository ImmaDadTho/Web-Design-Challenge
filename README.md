# Web-Design-Challenge

In this project I create a website and dashboard to display weather data plots that compare the latitude 
to various variables including `temperature`, `humidity`, `cloudiness` and `wind speed`. The website conisist of 
seven pages. One page will be a landing page and another page that presents the data used to build the plots.
The are two folders `CSS` and `images` that are located in the `assets` folder. I also have four html files that
show the images and a description of the plot in the `visualization` folder. I also have a resource folder 
containing the raw data.

## Index page
  This page is the home page and from here you will be able to navigate to all the plots available by either 
  clicking on the images or using the navigation menu to navigate to the plot desired.

## Lat Vs. Pages
  Created four visualization pages that contain a plot in each and a paragraph describing the data in the plot
  and any correlation discovered from the plot. 

## Comparisons page
  This page displays all the plots at once without any description or information just the images, you are 
  able to navigate to any plot to get more details by clicking on the image.

## Data page
  This page has the raw data that was used for the plots in a table format.
  
### Page layout and functions
  You are able to minimize the website and the site will change to be more user friendly. The navigation menu succesffuly 
  naviagtes you to any plot from any page. You are able to click on the `Comparison` and `Data` tabs on any page and be 
  successfully linked to those pages, once your are in the comparison or data page the respective tab enlarges a bit to 
  let you know what page you are currently on. All pages can lead you back to the landing page by clicking `Latitude` 
  on the top left.
